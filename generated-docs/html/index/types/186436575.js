This is also included in the external value. When Node.js is used as an embedded library, this value may be 0 because allocations for ArrayBuffers may not be tracked in that case.\n","hashAnchor":"t","info":{"tag":"typeSynonym","value":{"arguments":[],"type":{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"Record"]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000r\u0000s\u0000s",{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"Int"]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000h\u0000e\u0000a\u0000p\u0000T\u0000o\u0000t\u0000a\u0000l",{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"Int"]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000h\u0000e\u0000a\u0000p\u0000U\u0000s\u0000e\u0000d",{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"Int"]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000e\u0000x\u0000t\u0000e\u0000r\u0000n\u0000a\u0000l",{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"Int"]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000a\u0000r\u0000r\u0000a\u0000y\u0000B\u0000u\u0000f\u0000f\u0000e\u0000r\u0000s",{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"Int"]},{"tag":"REmpty","annotation":null}]}]}]}]}]}]}}},"moduleName":"Node.Process","name":"MemoryUsage","packageInfo":{"tag":"package","value":"node-process"},"score":0,"sourceSpan":{"end":{"column":4,"line":426},"name":".spago/p/node-process-11.2.0/src/Node/Process.purs","start":{"column":1,"line":420}}}]
