It is the same value as process.cpuUsage().user.\n- `systemCPUTime` <integer> maps to ru_stime computed in microseconds. It is the same value as process.cpuUsage().system.\n- `maxRSS` <integer> maps to ru_maxrss which is the maximum resident set size used in kilobytes.\n- `sharedMemorySize` <integer> maps to ru_ixrss but is not supported by any platform.\n- `unsharedDataSize` <integer> maps to ru_idrss but is not supported by any platform.\n- `unsharedStackSize` <integer> maps to ru_isrss but is not supported by any platform.\n- `minorPageFault` <integer> maps to ru_minflt which is the number of minor page faults for the process, see this article for more details.\n- `majorPageFault` <integer> maps to ru_majflt which is the number of major page faults for the process, see this article for more details. This field is not supported on Windows.\n- `swappedOut` <integer> maps to ru_nswap but is not supported by any platform.\n- `fsRead` <integer> maps to ru_inblock which is the number of times the file system had to perform input.\n- `fsWrite` <integer> maps to ru_oublock which is the number of times the file system had to perform output.\n- `ipcSent` <integer> maps to ru_msgsnd but is not supported by any platform.\n- `ipcReceived` <integer> maps to ru_msgrcv but is not supported by any platform.\n- `signalsCount` <integer> maps to ru_nsignals but is not supported by any platform.\n- `voluntaryContextSwitches` <integer> maps to ru_nvcsw which is the number of times a CPU context switch resulted due to a process voluntarily giving up the processor before its time slice was completed (usually to await availability of a resource). This field is not supported on Windows.\n- `involuntaryContextSwitches` <integer> maps to ru_nivcsw which is the number of times a CPU context switch resulted due to a higher priority process becoming runnable or because the current process exceeded its time slice.
