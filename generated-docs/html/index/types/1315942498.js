When programming with Promises, exceptions are encapsulated as \"rejected promises\". Rejections can be caught and handled using promise.catch() and are propagated through a Promise chain. The 'unhandledRejection' event is useful for detecting and keeping track of promises that were rejected whose rejections have not yet been handled.\n","hashAnchor":"v","info":{"tag":"value","value":{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Node","EventEmitter","UtilTypes"],"EventHandle2"]},{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Node","Process"],"Process"]}]},{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Foreign"],"Foreign"]}]},{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Foreign"],"Foreign"]}]}},"moduleName":"Node.Process","name":"unhandledRejectionH","packageInfo":{"tag":"package","value":"node-process"},"score":0,"sourceSpan":{"end":{"column":60,"line":186},"name":".spago/p/node-process-11.2.0/src/Node/Process.purs","start":{"column":1,"line":186}}},{"comments":"Args:\n- `err` <Error> The uncaught exception.\n- `origin` <string> Indicates if the exception originates from an unhandled rejection or from a synchronous error. \n   Can either be 'uncaughtException' or 'unhandledRejection'. \n   The latter is used when an exception happens in a Promise based async context (or if a Promise is rejected) \n   and `--unhandled-rejections` flag set to `strict` or `throw` (which is the default) and \n   the rejection is not handled, or when a rejection happens during the command line entry point's \n   ES module static loading phase.\n\nThe 'uncaughtException' event is emitted when an uncaught JavaScript exception bubbles \nall the way back to the event loop. By default, Node.js handles such exceptions \nby printing the stack trace to `stderr` and exiting with code 1, \noverriding any previously set `process.exitCode`. \nAdding a handler for the 'uncaughtException' event overrides this default behavior. \nAlternatively, change the process.exitCode in the 'uncaughtException' handler which will \nresult in the process exiting with the provided exit code. Otherwise, in the presence of \nsuch handler the process will exit with 0.\n\n'uncaughtException' is a crude mechanism for exception handling intended to be used only as a last resort. The event should not be used as an equivalent to On Error Resume Next. Unhandled exceptions inherently mean that an application is in an undefined state. Attempting to resume application code without properly recovering from the exception can cause additional unforeseen and unpredictable issues.\n\nExceptions thrown from within the event handler will not be caught. Instead the process will exit with a non-zero exit code and the stack trace will be printed. This is to avoid infinite recursion.\n\nAttempting to resume normally after an uncaught exception can be similar to pulling out the power cord when upgrading a computer. Nine out of ten times, nothing happens. But the tenth time, the system becomes corrupted.\n\nThe correct use of 'uncaughtException' is to perform synchronous cleanup of allocated resources (e.g. file descriptors, handles, etc) before shutting down the process. It is not safe to resume normal operation after 'uncaughtException'.\n\nTo restart a crashed application in a more reliable way, whether 'uncaughtException' is emitted or not, an external monitor should be employed in a separate process to detect application failures and recover or restart as needed.\n","hashAnchor":"v","info":{"tag":"value","value":{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Node","EventEmitter","UtilTypes"],"EventHandle2"]},{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Node","Process"],"Process"]}]},{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Effect","Exception"],"Error"]}]},{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},"moduleName":"Node.Process","name":"uncaughtExceptionH","packageInfo":{"tag":"package","value":"node-process"},"score":0,"sourceSpan":{"end":{"column":56,"line":178},"name":".spago/p/node-process-11.2.0/src/Node/Process.purs","start":{"column":1,"line":178}}},{"hashAnchor":"v","info":{"tag":"value","value":{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Yoga","Om","Layer"],"OmLayer"]},{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Test","Playground"],"ConfigL_"]}]},{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Test","Playground"],"DatabaseL_"]}]},{"tag":"REmpty","annotation":null}]}},"moduleName":"Test.Playground","name":"databaseLayer","packageInfo":{"tag":"unknown"},"score":0,"sourceSpan":{"end":{"column":48,"line":34},"name":"packages/yoga-om-layer/test/Playground.purs","start":{"column":1,"line":34}}},{"hashAnchor":"v","info":{"tag":"value","value":{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Yoga","Om","Layer"],"OmLayer"]},{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Test","Playground"],"ConfigL_"]}]},{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Test","Playground"],"LoggerL_"]}]},{"tag":"REmpty","annotation":null}]}},"moduleName":"Test.Playground","name":"loggerLayer","packageInfo":{"tag":"unknown"},"score":0,"sourceSpan":{"end":{"column":44,"line":28},"name":"packages/yoga-om-layer/test/Playground.purs","start":{"column":1,"line":28}}},{"comments":"Complete
